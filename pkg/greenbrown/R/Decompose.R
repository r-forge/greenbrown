	### Maximum p-value for the OLS-MOSUM test in order to search for breakpoints. If p = 0.05, breakpoints will be only searched in the time series trend component if the OLS-MOSUM test indicates a significant structural change in the time series. If p = 1 breakpoints will be always searched regardless if there is a significant structural change in the time series or not.
	
	##details<<
	## The decomposition of the time series is based on a simple step-wise approach:
	## \itemize{
	## \item{ The mean of the NDVI time series is calculated. }
	## \item{ In the second step, monthly values are aggregated per year by using the average value and the trend is calculated based on annual aggregated values using \code{ \link{TrendAAT}}. }
	## \item{ The mean of the time series and the derived trend component from step (2) are subtracted from the annual values to derive the trend-removed and mean-centred annual values (annual anomalies). If the trend slope is not significant (p > 0.05), only the mean is subtracted. }
	## \item{ In the next step, the mean, the trend component and the annual anomalies are subtracted from the original time series to calculate a detrended, mean-centered and for annual anomalies adjusted time series. From this time series the seasonal cycle is estimated as the mean seasonal cycle. }
	## \item{ In the last step, the short-term anomalies are computed. For this, the mean, the trend component, the annual anomalies and the mean seasonal cycle are subtracted from the original time series. } }
